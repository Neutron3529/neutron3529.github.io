# Adding a new github page

Actually, github generate every `.md` file you uploaded to the server.

As for this page, you could visit it by 'https://neutron3529.github.io/test'

> For normal `.md` file, it is. but for `Readme.md`, you should just visit its folder, i.e., visit `https://neutron3529.github.io/nginx` if you upload a file `nginx/README.md`

If you're aiming at creating a reuseable page, using relative path could be a better choice.
